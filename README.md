# SafePath-Advanced-Obstacle-Aware-Cruise-Control-System ðŸš—
- An Intelligent Pothole Detection (YOLOv8) and Depth Estimation (LiDAR) Cruise Control System (Raspberry Pi 4 and Arduino UNO)
    - Detects potholes using a real-time camera attached to Raspberry Pi.
    - Measures the depth of the pothole using a LiDAR sensor.
    - Uses serial communication from the sensor connected to Arduino to Raspberry Pi.
    - Based on this, potholes are classified as Safe, Medium, or Risk.
    - The speed of the vehicle is adjusted accordingly.
    - Built as a prototype model.
